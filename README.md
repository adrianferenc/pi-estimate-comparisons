# π Estimate Comparisons

This app compares various methods of estimating π by using partial sums of infinite series in most cases and the Monte Carlo Method in one other. 

The App is made with React, Node, Bootstrap, react-bootstrap, Mathjax, react-mathjax, Plotly.js, react-plotly.js

### Still to work on:
- Add various scatterplots (probably made with python and matplotlib and saved as svg or png or jpeg?)
